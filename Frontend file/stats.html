                <p class="para">The NGO works to the role of indictors and viewers, regardless of the lack of legal, cultural and social grounds necessary for them to take an active part in criminal proceedings in our country; and, in effect, they face such limitations and ambiguities as criteria of the recognition of their qualifications to do so. The NGO's vision is to safeguard the rights and ensure justice to the victims of atrocities. The present study is intended to examine grounds of and barriers to NGOâ€™s activity in criminal proceedings and to address vital roles they can play in the rape prevention and their involvement with legal proceedings.</p>
                <h1>Analysis</h1>
                <p class="para">We have used various python tools like data analysis and wrangling (pandas, numpy), visualization (seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, plotly) in order to analyse this dataset and find out the number of rape cases in various states of India both statewise as well as agewise. Our analysis is focusing on the dataset between 2001 - 2010. We tried our best to depict every analysis with the help of screenshots of graphs and figures.</p>

                <h4>1: Total case Yearwise</h4>
                <img src='resources/Stats/image%201.jpeg'>
                <p class="para">The graph evidently shows that the number of rape cases have increased over the years. This increase triggers a sense of alarm, questioning the safety and rights of an individual, and eventually the faith on the governing bodies and administration.</p>

                <p class="para">This graph shows each state with it's group of victims. Between 2000-2010 there were 190K reported cases , most of these cases were in Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra. In Lakshadweep, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Puducherry, we saw the low number, meaning in these states we have known communities of the rape harm on women, not like the other states that have large victims of rape.</p>

                <p class="para">The pie chart depicts the distribution of data as in victims in various subgroups on the basis of their age. The subgroups are upto 10,10-14,14-18, 18-30,30-50, above 50 years of age. The distribution shows that the most number of victims are of the age between 18-30, especially the ones who stepped into the young adulthood</p>

                <img src='resources/Stats/image%204.jpeg'>
                <p class="para">The trends of Incest rape cases in the age group 18-30 years were significantly higher but uniformly low for the 10 years of age. Incidentally, the maximum numbers of victims were between 18-30 years of age with the number crossing 1750 cases.</p>

                <p class="para">The trends of other rape cases in the age group 18-30 years were significantly higher but uniformly low for the 10 years of age. So we can say, the maximum number of victims were between 18-30 years of age with the number crossing 10000 cases.</p>

                <img src='resources/Stats/image%206.jpeg'>
                <p class="para">The above graph depicts the total number of victims agewise according to the state. We tried to represent the same by segregating the victims agewise with the help of diffent colours and then plotting the numbers on the graph statewise. With the help of the above graph, we can conclude that Madhya Pradesh has seen the highest number of cases while on the other hand, the seven sisters and union territories like Daman & Diu, Goa and Puducherry have seen the least.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="para">Finally, we finished our case study about rape victims in India between 2000-2010, we observed there are states that have huge numbers of rape cases. Unfortunately,this number is increasing every year. If India does not do anything to improve this situation, a catastrophe is not far.

Women are our half community, and we have to respect them and make sure that they are safe.They are our moms, sisters, daughters, friends, collegues, wives and our companions. Every Indian must take measures to improve this situation. It's high time we buck up and realise our responsiblities towards the society and our women and not just read these articles on newspapers but also take certain initiatives on ground. And this situation cannot be improved by locking women at home but teaching men the correct way to behave because it was evident in the above report that only "roads" are not the only unsafe place for women but sometimes their own "homes". </p>
