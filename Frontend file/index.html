                <p class="para">Crime, the intentional commission of an act usually deemed socially harmful or dangerous and specifically defined, prohibited, and punishable under criminal law.</p>
<p>
Most countries have enacted a criminal code in which all of the criminal law can be found, though English law—the source of many other criminal-law systems—remains uncodified. The definitions of particular crimes contained in a code must be interpreted in the light of many principles, some of which may not actually be expressed in the code itself. For example, many legal systems take into account the mental state of the accused person at the time the alleged crime was committed. Most legal systems also classify crimes for the purpose of assigning cases to different types of court. Social changes often result in the adoption of new criminal laws and the obsolescence of older ones.</p>

                <p class="para"> 
                    Rape is often described as unwanted or forced 'sex' – or 'sex' that happened without consent. But, sex can only happen when everyone consents. Rape, on the other hand, is a form of sexual violence and a serious crime. </p>
                    <p>Rape happens when someone didn't want to have sex or didn't give their consent for sex to happen.

It is a form of sexual violence and a very serious crime that carries the same maximum sentence as murder.

No-one ever deserves or asks for rape to happen. 100% of the blame lies with the perpetrator or perpetrators.

However, many of the myths surrounding rape can make victims and survivors feel as though they are somehow to blame. It can also make them feel that what happened to them wasn’t ‘real’ rape.</p>

        <div><h2>How Rape is defined in law in India.</h2>
            <p class="para">
                ‘Rape’ as a clearly defined offence was first introduced in the Indian Penal Code in 1860. Prior to this, there were often diverse and conflicting laws prevailing across India. The codification of Indian laws began with the enactment of the Charter Act, 1833 by the British Parliament which led to the establishment of the first Law Commission under the chairmanship of Lord Macaulay.
            </p>
            <p><b>Section 375 of the IPC made punishable the act of sex by a man with a woman if it was done against her will or without her consent. </b>The definition of rape also included sex when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested, in fear of death or of hurt.

                <b>Also, sex with or without her consent, when she is under 18 years is considered rape.</b> However, under the exception, sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.

Section 376 provided for seven years of jail term to life imprisonment to whoever commits the offence of rape.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="dotted"><b>It doesn’t matter who the person committing the rape is – if there is no consent then it is always rape. And that includes within marriage and relationships.</b></p>

        <div><h2>Rape and other types of sexual violence.</h2>
            <p class="para">Many people have experiences of sexual assault or sexual abuse that do not fit the legal definition of rape. However, that doesn't mean their experience isn't 'as bad'. 

In fact, all sexual assault and sexual abuse is a serious crime.

Some victims and survivors also describe what happened to them as 'rape' even if it doesn't fit the legal definition. And that's completely fine.

At Rape Crisis, we use words that are meaningful to the victim or survivor, not just legal terms.</p>

        <div><h2>What is consent?</h2>
            <p class="para">
                Consenting to having another person’s penis inside your vagina, anus or mouth means agreeing to it by choice and having both the freedom and capacity to make that choice.

It is NOT consent if you or someone else was:

Asleep, unconscious, drunk, drugged or 'on' drugs.
Pressured, manipulated, tricked or scared into saying yes.
Too young or vulnerable to have the freedom and capacity to make that choice.
Consent can be withdrawn at any time, including during sex or a sexual act. Just because someone consented to something before doesn’t mean they consented to it happening again.

If someone’s unsure whether the other person is giving their consent for something sexual, they should always check with them.

        <div><h2>'Types' of Rape.</h2>
            <p class="para">
                There are several types of rape. Rape is a violent crime involving sexual acts forced on one person by another. Rape is technically defined as forced penetration (with any body part or object) including anal, vaginal or oral intercourse. Rape is illegal and while the term "rape" specifies penetration, other sexual acts not involving penetration, when forced on someone, are also illegal.
            </p>
            <p>The forms of rape may be specified based on who is committing the rape, who the rape victim is and the specific actions involved in the rape. Some types of rape are considered much more severe than others.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li><h3>Incest</h3><p>Incest is a type of rape dictated by the relationship between the two parties. When the two parties involved in the sex act are closely related (in other words, they are family), it is often rape.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Partner Rape</h3><p>Partner rape, also known as spousal rape or marital rape, is a type of rape involving a person's partner or previous partner (no matter whether the partners are married).</p></li>
            <li><h3>Aggravated Rape</h3><p>Aggravated rape is a type of rape defined in the law.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Acquaintance Rape</h3><p>This type of rape happens between two people that know each other. Often acquaintance rape is known as "date rape" as the two people involved may be in a social relationship at the time. Some victims don't recognize acquaintance rape as rape but it's important to remember that consent for sexual activity can be revoked at any time and a prior relationship does not mean that rape cannot occur.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Other Types of Rape</h3><p>Rape can occur in many other ways as well, including by strangers or in conjunction with a hate crime. However, it's critical to remember that whatever form of rape occurs, it is always the fault of the rapist and never the fault of the victim.</p></li>

            <h2>Things we Can Do To Make A Difference</h2>
            <p>The time for prevention is now. You can make a difference in the fight to stop sexual violence. Here are five things you can do to help make a difference:

If you know someone who is a victim of sexual assault, reach out to them and let them know that you care and support them.</p>
            <p>Make your voice heard. Contact Congress about your support for legislation to improve the criminal justice system, bring sexual predators to justice and support survivors. Contact your member of Congress about legislation that is important to victims of sexual violence.</p>
            <p>Donate your time. Volunteer and get involved in your community. There are so many ways to do this. Help your local rape crisis center, get involved on your campus, or volunteer for the online hotline.</p>
            <p>Get social. Share important information and articles to educate your social networks about sexual assault awareness and prevention.</p>
            <p>Join a support campaign. Help survivors and the community by joining campaigns that promote awareness and prevention as well as supporting victims.</p>
            <p>Most victims experience sexual violence before the age of 25. Although sexual violence and sexual assault are recognized as a widespread problem in communities, organizations and across campuses, we can help prevent these senseless attacks through proper awareness and responsible actions by the community at large. Sexual assault can be prevented, so it’s important that we work together to take action.</p>
